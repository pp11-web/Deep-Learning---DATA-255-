    "    1. RAG Output: Combines retrieved context from external sources (like a knowledge base or a document set) with the generative capabilities of GPT The retrieved context provides specific, relevant, and factual information, improving the quality and grounding of the response.\n",

    "2. Relevance and Specificity\n",
